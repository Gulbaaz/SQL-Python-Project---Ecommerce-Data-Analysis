## 🧩 Dataset Description

This project uses **7 relational tables**:

- **customers**  
- **orders**  
- **order_items**  
- **products**  
- **sellers**  
- **payments**  
- **geolocation**  

They collectively form a real-world ecommerce transaction system.

# 🐍 Python Phase — ETL Into MySQL

A Python script using `mysql-connector` automatically imports all CSV files into MySQL in minutes:

- Connects to MySQL  
- Creates tables  
- Reads each CSV  
- Inserts data efficiently  

This simulates a real ETL workflow.

# 🗄 SQL Analysis

SQL tasks are divided into three levels:

---

## 🟢 **Basic Queries**
1. Unique customer cities  
2. Orders placed in 2017  
3. Total sales per category  
4. % of orders paid in installments  
5. Customer count by state  

---

## 🟡 **Intermediate Queries**
6. Orders per month in 2018  
7. Avg products per order by customer city  
8. Revenue % by product category  
9. Correlation between price & purchase frequency  
10. Seller revenue ranking  

---

## 🔴 **Advanced Queries**
11. Moving average of order values  
12. Monthly cumulative sales  
13. YoY (Year-over-Year) growth rate  
14. Customer retention rate (repeat purchase within 6 months)  

All queries are included in **03_SQL_Queries_On_Python/**.
